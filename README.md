<h1>Wordle Recreated Java</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a Java-based take on the classic word puzzle game Wordle, built using IntelliJ IDEA and managed with Maven. It runs right in the terminal and lets players guess a five-letter word with a limited number of tries. After each guess, the game gives feedback on which letters are correct and in the right position, just like the original.The game reads from an external word list and handles everything from input validation to tracking attempts and displaying results. The code is cleanly organized and easy to build on, whether you want to add a graphical interface with JavaFX, create a solver, or connect it to a web front end.
